# COP2270 â€“ C Programming for Engineers

Welcome to the official repository for **COP2270 â€“ C Programming for Engineers**.  
This course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of programming using the C language, with a focus on engineering applications. Students will gain hands-on experience writing, compiling, testing, and debugging C programs.

## Course Description

COP2270 is a foundational course designed for engineering students. It provides a practical approach to learning C programming concepts including:

- Data types and variables
- Operators and expressions
- Control flow (if statements, loops)
- Functions and modular programming
- Arrays and strings
- File input/output
- Problem-solving through algorithms and code implementation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Write syntactically correct and efficient C programs.
- Apply control structures (if, switch, while, for) to solve engineering problems.
- Develop modular programs using functions and header files.
- Use arrays and strings to process and store data.
- Handle basic file operations for input and output.
- Understand memory management and variable scope.

## Tools & Requirements

- **Compiler**: GCC or TDM-GCC (via Code::Blocks IDE)
- **IDE**: [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) or [OnlineGDB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/)
- **Operating System**: Windows/macOS/Linux
